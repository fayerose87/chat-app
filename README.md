# Getting Started  

## Setup
### Clone this repository 
`git clone https://github.com/fayerose87/chat-app.git`

### Go to project's root directory
`cd chat-app`

### Install dependencies
`npm install`  

### Run the project using expo 
`expo start` or `npx expo start`   

### Create an Expo account   
Set up an [Expo account](expo.dev), then download the Expo app on your smartphone from the App Store. (Take a look at Expo's [Installation Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) for additional details.)

From there, you can open the chat app on your phone by scanning the QR code that gets generated after running `expo start`.

### Set Up a Firebase database 
Set up a [Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/). Details on how to set up the database can be found in the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs).    

_Note: you will need to setup your own Firebase database and add your own database credentials in /components/chat.js, under the "Firebase Config Details", then allow anonymous authorization with your Database._)
